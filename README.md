This is a university group project from the subject "Big Data and Databases". It concerns using machine learning to analyse big data. It was done in both Python and Knime. It was graded 30.1/30 (where 31 is 30 with honours). 

All the uploaded notebooks are my work. As for the presentation, slides 53, 54, 56-64, 68-85 are mainly my own work, except for maybe stylistic choices. The rest was created by my amazing classmates. However, we all cross checked our work and the entirety of the presentation would not be possible without a few days of deep cooperation.
